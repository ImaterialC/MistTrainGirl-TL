## Overview
This reposition is a fusion of two framework:
- **Localify** [GitHub Release v3.0.0Beta](https://github.com/chinosk6/gakuen-imas-localify/releases/tag/v3.0.0Beta)

  - XUnity Auto Translate
  - Application resizing
  - Forced full screen (Alt+Enter)<br>
  
  
This patch builds upon Localify by adding crucial functionalities that were missing.
